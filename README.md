- 🌱 I’m currently learning html, hopefully I'll get beyond what I learned in grade school.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on art stuff tbh.
- 📫 How to reach me: find me on Palia as "Dicey Kidd" lmao
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a twin brother who does coding for his job. Another fun fact is this was the username I was given for my college email.
