- 👋 Hi, I’m Kelsey.
- 👀 I’m interested in making a better EHR system, but also in video games. Like, a lot.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html, hopefully I'll get beyond what I learned in grade school.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on art stuff tbh.
- 📫 How to reach me: find me on Palia as "Dicey Kidd" lmao.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a twin brother who does coding for his job. We'll see if I learn enough to make something.
